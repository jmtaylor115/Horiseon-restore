# Code Refactor Starter Code


Horiseon is a webpage that contains details about how to optimize your site for a search engine. When given the base code for the site, there are errors throughout. I then looked at the code and optimizzed it in a way I thought I could best. dettailed below are things that I changed from the source code. 

* Started by making the text more readable by increasing the size.

* Fixed the link to the Search Engine Optimization portion of the site

* Removed height from css in body to prevent overlap in minimized window

* Rearranged css so that the content was in the same order as the index.html file

* Adjusted the imagess in the body with relative positions so that the images fall inside tthe blue background

* Added commenting on the css page
